This is the location of the main **Starline Tours **Hollywood Terminal where the Starline City Sightseeing Hop-on hop-off Red Route, Purple Route & Blue Route all originate from. Other Starline Tours departing from here include the **Original Movie Stars' Homes Tour**, and tours to all major Southern California Attractions such as Warner Brothers' VIP Studio Tour, Universal Studios Hollywood, Disneyland & Sea World of San Diego.

The world-famous **Grauman's TCL Chinese Theatre **has hosted more movie premieres than any other movie theater in the world, and continues to host them on a regular basis to this very day. One of the main draws is the cement hand-prints and footprints of the many celebrities who have had their movies premiered here over the years. You can still go to see a movie at this theater when there isn't a premiere going on.

Next door sits **Hollywood & Highland Center**, a magnificent retail, dining and entertainment complex.

The crown jewel of Hollywood & Highland is the **Dolby Theatre**-- home of the annual Academy Awards ceremony in February.

Hollywood and Highland also provides great views of the world-famous**Hollywood Sign**.

On the other side of the TCL Chinese Theatre sits **Madame Tussauds Hollywood**, where you can interact with life-like wax figures of your favorite celebrities.
